* Git
* GitHub
* React

* MongoDB

## Approach Taken
I started my app by checking out existing apps related to my app. Built a model with 2 collections, one for users, one for posts. Understand the relationships between the various functions, create appropriate components and the relationship between them.
## Wins and Blockers
### Wins

I enjoyed get to know with new things, like authenticatinon and uploading photos, libraries for use and experiment with new techniques.
### Blockers
If I were to make the app again I would give myself more time to create a responsive app.
Use API and add search places in the world and get more information.
